Our main goal is to clean up the world and at the same time pay locals good money to do the job.

Scoop Solutions makes sure people or companies who want to spend money making the world a more beautiful place can pay locals to do so. We guarantee that at least 50% of the money goes directly to the locals doing the beach cleaning*.

We believe direct trading and giving meaningful and well-paid work to the locals is the key to development instead of just giving away aid money. With Scoop Solutions, the locals are both doing something useful and at the same time earn well-needed money doing it.



*At first 50 % maybe doesn't seem a lot, but this is actually one of the highest rates of any company and organization giving aid and help to people in more need. If we succeed in this project, we are planning to even increase the percentage going to the locals. Our main goal is always to clean up the world and at the same time give the locals good money doing the job.
